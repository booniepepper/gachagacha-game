VCSL

Your one-stop-sound-shop for samples, the Versilian Community Sample Library project contains dozens of orchestral, world, and experimental instruments professionally recorded and edited. For composers, a set of SFZ format patches are provided to allow use in any DAW in combination with Plogue Sforzando player. Please download Sforzando and watch the video tutorial for instructions on how to use SFZ files.

This collection is under a Creative Commons 0 (zero) license. Essentially it’s Public Domain- you can do whatever you want with these sounds (even make commercial software), no royalties, no credit, no special terms. This includes integrating it in projects such as generative music, DAWs, granular synthesizers, and samplers.

Pulse redemption keys are available for a nominal contribution of $2.50 to offset the cost of the download. If you would like to contribute a greater amount, please use the paypal.me link down below under ‘Development’. All contributions are earmarked specifically for VCSL and other freeware projects.
