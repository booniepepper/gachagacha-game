# GachaGacha

## Key-mashing game for babies and toddlers

Anyone under a certain age cannot withstand the allure of a keyboard. So many
buttons, and the big folk sure love it...

This is a very simple game built with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) for the very
young. When launched it runs full-screen and pressing keyboard keys 

GachaGacha gets its name from ガチャガチャ, a Japanese onomatopoeia for the
clacking sound of a keyboard.
